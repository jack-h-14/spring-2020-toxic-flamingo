# This is the final project of TOXIC FLAMINGO

**Product Vision Statement:**
<em> Sharmony is a web-based application for fans to discover and share the music they enjoy. Unlike other platforms such as Spotify, Sharmony focuses on fostering community through grassroots music recommendations from real people, not algorithms. </em>

**History of Sharmony:**
<em> The idea of Sharmony was conceived when Kay James became disenchanted with the robotic algorithms that rule our lives. Popular platforms rely on algorithms for recommmending new music to users; this leaves only a narrow selection and hinders less popular songs from gaining traction. After being grouped together in a software engineering class, the Sharmony team developed a solution to the algorithm problem with a social music recommendation application, powered by passionate users sharing the music that they love. </em>
